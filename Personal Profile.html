  <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
  <p>I am a professional individual with 15 years proven rewarding international experience working in a highly regulated and fast paced banking environment. Qualified as an IT Support Specialist with a passion for ICT and Customer Service, I am now
    seeking to redirect my career within ICT, and to eventually progress to Cyber Security. I have a solution-focussed approach with a high capacity to adapt, and an ability to learn and progress rapidly. This has allowed me to stand out and achieve
    the highest performance rating of “strong and outstanding” with my current employer. I am always keen to improve my skills and performance, and have enrolled in further education and attended regular webinars to stay informed of new technologies.
    In turn, this has helped me to be selected to participate in various IT-related projects, such as AI and Robotics. This has resulted in me obtaining a national performance award Q1-2019 for this work. I strongly believe that my IT certification
    combined with my previous banking experience and wish to succeed will contribute greatly in achieving high performance and benefits for my future employer. I am therefore actively looking for an opportunity to join a reputed organisation to share
    and develop my knowledge in order to extend my career in the IT industry.
